## Creating an Air Pollution Warning System
#### Contributors: Yang Yu, Jing Wang, Chu Chu

In the recent years, China has been experiencing an increasing level of air pollution across its major cities. Guangzhou, a major southern city in China, collected hourly air pollution throughout year 2012 to 2015 along with data on other environmental factors. In this dataset, PM2.5 value is collected as the indicator of air pollution level, as it represents the concentration of fine particles in the air. We created a statistical model to predict air pollution level for the city based on previously collected data and created a daily alert system to inform citizens of Guangzhou on whether or not they should wear a mask outside. Additionally, for the purpose of educating the public, we generated daily, weekly, and monthly summary information for air pollution trends in Guangzhou.
